# Contributing to AurorOS & compiling OS

Thanks for your interest in contributing to AurorOS. This is a quick guide how to contribute to AurorOS.

## Code writing standards

There are standards in writing code for AurorOS and to not make ten next useless commits reverting the change, please read `AurorOS Code-writing standards` below.

1. Use [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) style.
2. Never make directory in repo root folder if this is not absolutelly necessary (read [your creation warning](#contributing-to-the-apps)).
3. Do not use `#include "../include/something_there.h"`. Instead, use `#include <something_there.h>`.
4. Do not make any C or other non-header files in `include` directory.

Your pull request will be **rejected** if any of standards above is not used in your code.

## Contributing to AurorOS Kernel

If you want to contribute to AurorOS kernel you need to have previous experience with OS-dev. You can break the code very easily, so always [compile the OS](#compiling-and-running-auroros) and check the changes. Every change must be described with English and can't rebuild the entire kernel (if you want, make issue as feature request).

## Contributing to the apps

The apps are not that easy to break, so you can do more changes. 

> [!TIP]
> Avoid creating absolutelly new apps.

Before doing any changes, please learn our [stdlib](https://github.com/Interpuce/stdlib)

## Compiling and running AurorOS

### Compilation

> [!CAUTION]
> You will do this only at your own risk. We don't officially support any OS builds compiled by the user.

First - make sure you have Linux distribution installed and you are going to execute these commands on Linux distribution.

To clone, compile and run virtually AurorOS you will need `git`, `make`, `python3`, `gcc`, `nasm`, `binutils` and `qemu-system-x86_64` installed. 

On Debian-based distributions you can install these by executing this command:

```sudo apt install make python3 gcc binutils nasm qemu-system-x86_64```

On Arch-based distributions you can execute this command to install packages:
```sudo pacman -S make python gcc binutils nasm qemu```

Clone the repository to the current folder skipping unnecessary commit history:

```git clone https://github.com/Interpuce/AurorOS . --depth 1```

Run this command in AurorOS repo root folder:

```make```

or alternatively:

```make shbuild```

# Running AurorOS

This will generate ISO in iso directory.
